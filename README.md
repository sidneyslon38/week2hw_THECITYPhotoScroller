## Photo Scrolly Site_Template from THE CITY

I used this template from THE CITY to make a fake photo scroller site of an article I published with the NYCNews Service in January 2026.

I had Copilot point me to where the editable files are. Once I updated the photos and text, it worked locally. Then, I used the chat's help to remove the footer, and THE CITY logo on slide0 (aka the front page).

Deploying it has caused me some problems. I'm seeing "errors" in one of the .json files but I don't know how to fix it!!
