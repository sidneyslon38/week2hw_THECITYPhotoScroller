    slideContent: "Nestled against the side wall of a South Brooklyn shopping center sits a small dead end street, where the Gravesend Bay shoreline splashes up against rocks and garbage. The few trees that grow along the sidewalk there are spindly, their eroded roots covered in food trash and rat holes. For years, this patch of asphalt, named Caesar’s Bay, has been nothing but a parking spot or a place to dump garbage. According to local residents, it hasn’t always been this way. {newParagraph}“I remember when I was eight, I used to play there with my cousin. We used to climb those rocks, find crabs,” said Anton Revich, a lifelong Bensonhurst resident. “Over the years there was no real upkeep,” he said. “It just kept getting worse and worse.” Revich is an active volunteer and board member at Pineapple Ride, a local nonprofit that focuses on bike safety and public space rehabilitation.{newParagraph}Over the course of 2025, Pineapple Ride organizers began directing their focus to converting Caesar’s Bay into a permanent pedestrian plaza. If the city’s Department of Transportation approves the conversion, it would not only create a new public space, but it would also be unprecedented for the area.{newParagraph}Despite the 92 pedestrian plazas across New York City, Transportation Alternatives, a transit and pedestrian safety nonprofit, says that zero percent of South Brooklyn residents, from Bay Ridge to Coney Island, are “within walking distance” to one. Plazas differ from traditional parks, because they are typically city streets reclaimed as pedestrianized spaces, and can host things like artists’ murals, benches and public programming events. Caesar’s Bay is poised to become the first South Brooklyn pedestrian plaza, permanently removing cars from the waterfront space.",

      "Jim Lammers with StreetLab, an open streets organizer working with Pineapple Ride, said the project offers a unique new feature to the city. Apart from a couple of other examples, “there are no waterfront plazas really,” he said. Lammers also expressed confidence in the plaza’s long-term feasibility.{newParagraph}“This is a really unique space that has a lot of potential,” he said, adding that he thinks Pineapple Ride is “ready to be the stewards” of Caesar’s Bay.{newParagraph}In November 2024, Pineapple Ride took first steps to revitalizing the dead end. They organized a number of trash cleanups along the waterfront there, where they have since collected over 1,500 pounds of garbage, said Mirza Medunjanin, one the group’s founders, at a November 2025 community board meeting. The group has also hosted 11 daylong open street events at Caesar’s Bay, with StreetLab’s help. These temporary events have helped gain community support for the street’s conversion.{newParagraph}While these efforts are barely over a year old, Pineapple Ride has existed for much longer. Founded twelve years ago by three high school friends, it was originally a bicycle club that hosted annual rides around different parts of the city.{newParagraph}“In the first ride that we did, it was only like 15 to 20 people,” said Artem Brilev, a Pineapple Ride founder. “Mainly just our friends.” The group rides have continued every year, but it wasn’t until they incorporated as a nonprofit that their mission expanded. “That's when we started thinking about what we really can do,” he said, pointing to Caesar’s Bay as a next step for community change.{newParagraph}Now in 2026, their efforts to pedestrianize Caesar’s Bay are only increasing, with plans to submit an official request to the Department of Transportation for the new permanent plaza. “No one really thought about that waterfront,” said Roman Gun, a Pineapple Ride organizer and Bensonhurst native. “I don't think anyone really had a vision for it, so that's why this is particularly exciting.” While StreetLab has called this project a “slam dunk,” the group still faces hurdles in accomplishing their goal.{newParagraph}For example, the shoreline still collects pollution despite previous cleanup efforts. “Trash accumulates there in high tides, and a lot of people also dump garbage there,” said Daniel Leyzerzon, a Bensonhurst resident who attended recent trash cleanups. As permanent stewards of the street, Pineapple Ride would be responsible for continuously keeping the space clean, which Lammers calls a “unique challenge” compared to other plazas.{newParagraph}There’s also the challenge of proving broad community support for the permanent space. City standards require at least “eight letters of support from community stakeholders,” among other requirements for an organization to be approved for a permanent plaza. Brooklyn Community Board 11 provided one as recently as October 2025, unanimously agreeing to support the project through 2026. Medunjanin shared that they are still gathering more letters, though he feels confident many neighborhood residents support the project based on reactions from past open street events.{newParagraph}At a Caesar’s Bay open street day in November 2025, Pineapple Ride’s most recent event, volunteer Dmitry Troshin said over 100 neighborhood residents showed up, including many families with children. Local businesses also attended, a significant source of the project’s support so far.{newParagraph}Kay Xie, owner of Little Yams Bakery in Bensonhurst, sold low-sugar goods and brought games for children. She described the proposed plaza as exciting. “I think there's appeal because it’s right there next to the shopping center,” she said, adding that she feels it would attract foot traffic and a family-friendly atmosphere. Pineapple Ride’s open street days at the waterfront offer a glimpse into what a permanent plaza there could look like.{newParagraph}“The plaza is, I think, one of the most ambitious projects in South Brooklyn,” said Revich, who used to play on the rocks with his cousin. “There's nothing like it, and the community really needs something out there.”",
